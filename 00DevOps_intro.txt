DevOps - Introduction

Why DevOps Emerged in the Software Field:
-----------------------------------------
Modern software must be:
- High quality
- Delivered on time
- Aligned with user requirements
- Cost-effective

These goals are traditionally achieved using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle:
---------------------------------------
SDLC is a structured process with defined stages, traditionally handled by two separate teams:

Developer Team Responsibilities:
- Requirements Gathering
- Planning
- Designing
- Development (coding)

Operations Team Responsibilities:
- Build (compile, package)
- Testing (manual or automated)
- Deployment (release to production)
- Maintenance (updates, monitoring, bug fixes)

Challenges with Traditional SDLC Models:
----------------------------------------
1. Waterfall Model:
   - Linear and sequential approach.
   - Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
   - Low client interaction.
   - Difficult to implement changes once a phase is completed.
   - Poor collaboration between Development and Operations teams.
   - Low transparency and adaptability.

2. Agile Methodology:
   - More iterative and incremental.
   - Encourages regular client feedback at each stage.
   - Faster development cycles.
   - Better adaptability to change.
   - Still lacks full integration between Dev and Ops teams.

DevOps - A Modern Approach:
---------------------------
DevOps (Development + Operations) addresses limitations of previous models by:
- Bridging the gap between Development and Operations teams.
- Promoting a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.
- Using automation tools and practices across all stages.
- Enabling Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
- Improving speed, reliability, and quality of software delivery.

Key Benefits of DevOps:
- Faster time to market
- Improved deployment frequency
- Better product quality
- Enhanced customer satisfaction
- Reduced failures and quicker recovery
